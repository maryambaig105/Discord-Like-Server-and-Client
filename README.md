<h1>Discord-Like Server and Client/h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<br>**FIXING A SMALL BUG** In this project, I developed Developed DiSUcord, a message networking application resembling Discord. The Server manages messages, channels, and client interactions, handling multiple connections simultaneously. The Client acts as a user, subscribing to channels, sending messages, and viewing subscribed channel messages. The GUIs for both Client and Server provide a user-friendly interface, displaying detailed interactions, connection statuses, and channel-specific functionalities. The application ensures unique usernames, explicit multicasting, and graceful termination of processes.
